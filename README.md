Greetings!

We have recently received an encrypted message that appears to originate from the headquarters of High Science, as well as a strange image that cannot be opened properly. While the message is anonymous, according to our information, this image may contain something very important to us, most likely classified information straight from the secret archives.
Obtain this data at any cost. You may involve third parties.
